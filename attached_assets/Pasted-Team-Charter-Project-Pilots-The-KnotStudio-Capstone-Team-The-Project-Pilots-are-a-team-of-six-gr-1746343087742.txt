Team Charter – Project Pilots (The KnotStudio Capstone Team)
The Project Pilots are a team of six graduate students from Northeastern University’s Project Management program, collaborating to deliver a real-world capstone project for The KnotStudio. This charter defines our shared purpose, working structure, communication practices, and guiding principles to ensure successful project delivery.

Purpose
Our objective is to plan, manage, and execute a high-quality project using project management tools and methodologies. We are committed to aligning client expectations with academic outcomes through Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall practices.

Team Composition
Our team members bring varied experience from event planning, IT, construction, biotech, and operations. We rotate the role of Scrum Master weekly to foster shared leadership and learning.

Scrum Master: Leads weekly planning, progress tracking, and team coordination.

Developer Team: Executes project deliverables with responsibilities adjusted weekly based on the project phase.

Tools and Communication
We use structured communication methods to promote transparency and productivity:

Platforms: Microsoft Teams (documentation, meetings), Email (formal updates), WhatsApp (real-time updates)

Meetings:

Mondays: Virtual team meeting

Wednesdays: In-class check-in

Saturdays: Informal WhatsApp updates

Thursdays: Weekly client check-in (virtual)

Ground Rules
Attendance is mandatory at all meetings unless excused in advance.

All assigned work must be completed on time. Missed contributions are addressed progressively through team support, discussion, and potential escalation.

Drafts are expected 48 hours prior to deadlines for peer review.

Final versions are submitted to the shared drive at least 4 hours before the official deadline.

Conflict Resolution
Conflicts are addressed respectfully through open dialogue. If needed, the Scrum Master will mediate. If unresolved, the matter is escalated to the faculty advisor.

Decision-Making
Major decisions are made through team consensus. For urgent or minor matters, the current Scrum Master or designated lead may make the call after brief consultation.

Team Strengths Overview
Our team demonstrates strong organizational, analytical, and execution skills. Strengths like coaching and self-leadership contribute to positive morale and accountability. Recognizing areas for growth in strategic thinking and creative problem-solving, we proactively balance team responsibilities to develop in these areas.
